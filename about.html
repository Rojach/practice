<h1>This is about Angular JS</h1> 
AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps.</br> It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. </br>
Angular's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write.
